##Business Context

Insurance company always needs to be prepared to estimate the number of accidents and the claims that they can receive at a given point time. Also understanding the pattern of claims 
would help the companies to frame different types of policies for the users providing better benefits and at the same time increasing the premium to the company.

##Objective:
    +Explore the dataset to gain an understanding of insurance claim by different vehicle types 
    +Segment the types of vehicles and assess their claim status over the years 
    +Segment the types of vehicle owners based on their occupation, gender and age 
    +Assessing those segmented catgories to profile the appropriate risk based on their number of claims
    +New Risk Profile should help company charge higher premium on vehicles prone to incur higher claim rates and vice versa
