# Data Analysis Projects

This repository contains projects I have worked on throughout my data analysis journey. It serves as a portfolio for recruiters to review my work and for me to track my progress and skill development as a data analyst.

**[Warehouse Prediction Capstone Project](https://github.com/Ranjith-9/Projects/tree/main/SupplyChain_Predicition)**
* Predicted warehouse demand with 95% accuracy using regression models on two years of historical data; performed data cleaning, transformation, and standardization using Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn).
* Implemented and optimized regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost Regressor) focusing on key warehouse features to deliver accurate demand forecasts.

**[Resort Booking Cancellation Classification Project](https://github.com/Ranjith-9/Projects/tree/main/Resort_Cancellation_Prediction)**
* Developed a model to predict resort booking cancellations with 85% accuracy using two years of data; handled data cleaning and exploratory analysis in Python.
* Implemented and fine-tuned machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost) using scikit-learn, focusing on financial and logistic features to enhance decision-making processes.

**[Car Insurance Claims - Tableau Project](https://github.com/Ranjith-9/Projects/tree/main/CarInsurance_Visualization)**
* Developed a dashboard to analyze insurance claims made by various types of vehicle owners.
* The dashboard serves as a tool for updating and revising the risk profiles of vehicles.

**[Health Care Analysis - Neural Network Model (TensorFlow)](https://github.com/Ranjith-9/Projects/tree/main/HeathCare_Analysis)**
* Developed a neural network model with 96% accuracy using Tensorflow library to classify patient's condition 
* Optimized the model to prevent overfitting and enhance overall generalization.
